# ✈️ Airline Flight Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes flight delays and cancellations to discover trends across airlines, routes, and weather conditions.  
It uses Java with JDBC to query a PostgreSQL database and generate insights, which are then displayed in a dashboard UI.

---

## 🎯 Goal
- Identify major causes of flight delays and cancellations.  
- Provide insights on routes, airlines, and weather patterns.  
- Present findings in an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🚀 What I Did
- Wrote advanced SQL queries (joins, aggregates, window functions) in PostgreSQL.  
- Connected the database using Java + JDBC.  
- Processed large flight datasets (delays, routes, weather).  
- Built a Java-based dashboard with charts to visualize results.  

Result: A clear dashboard showing which airlines, routes, and weather conditions** cause the most delays.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Language: Java (JDBC, Collections, Streams)  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Visualization: JavaFX (charts, tables) or Swing  
- Build Tool: Maven or Gradle
